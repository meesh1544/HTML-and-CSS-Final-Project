    <H3>My Top 10 Tips and Tricks!</H3>   
    A few things I have learned along the way!
        <details>
            <summary>1.Teach your children Core Values</summary>
            <p> A lot has changed with family dynamics in recent years. When children are raised the 'core values', they learn to become respectful 
            and value the things around them. Before I had kids, my husband and I sat down and talked about how we wanted our kids to be raised. This 
            was very important to us and we made it a priority to be on the same page when it came to parenting. We have changed things along the way, 
            and even from child to child, but our main goal has always been to raise children to be respectful productive members of society</p>.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>2.Love the Little Moments</summary> 
            <p>A lot of parents often forget how much your kids love for you to get on the ground with them and play. It can be anything they choose
            to do that they enjoy doing with you, which most of the time ends in a 'Thank you', or 'I love you mom', or a hug and a kiss. It really 
            makes their day. We run around all day trying to acheive what we think we need to day in and day out, but our little ones wait for those 
            little moments when they can have your full attention.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>3.Praise your kids</summary>
            <p>How many times a day do we tell our kids
            "no" and "not right now", when we should be pointing out all of the positve things they are doing instead. Giving our children praise when 
            needed goes a long way. Most kids remember when they are disiplined, but when parents praise they kids when they do something right it 
            signals positive reinforcement. That allows different parts of the brain to 'remember' a good feeling that they will want to repeat.</p>
         </details>   
         <details>
            <summary>4. Prioritize</summary>
            <p>Prioritizing is difficult at times, but is the key to getting everything done in a days time. I priotirize the important items such as 
            breakfast, lunch and dinner, and add in playing a game or doing nails. Everyday is different and I try to have a goal for each day so that 
            when it comes to the weekend, I'm not overwhelmed with work.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>5. Disipline won't hurt them</summary> 
            <p>I disipline my children daily. I have found what works best is talking to them and figuring out what the problem is as soon as possible
            to correct the behavior. The disipline for my family includes sitting on the stairs, a consequence such as a cleaning the bathroom, saying 
            your sorry and giving hugs. Usually when I talk to my kids I can tell if they are lying or they are not lying, and that is the starting point.</p>
        </details>
        <details>   
            <summary>6. Mom Guilt</summary>
            <p>Wether you are a stay-at-home mom or a working mom, there is always a certain level of mom guilt. I have worked and not worked
            while raising my children, and I would have to say that the guilt is always there but changes because of the enviornment. It's ok to
            feel guilty, but just know that you are doing everything you can to make the best life for your little ones. They won't remember that 
            you missed their first step or their first word and that's okay. Make memories that they will remember.</p>
         </details>    
        <details>
            <summary>7.Family Activities</summary>
            <p>My family is a large family, and we do a lot of things together. We love to take walks, go to the beach, bike, etc. We will have 
            family movies nights and family game nights. It is always more fun when we do things as one unit. My 12 year old loves it as much as 
            my 2 year old and everyone in between.</p>
         </details>   
        <details>  
            <summary>8.Cook as a family</summary>
            <p>I cook daily for my family and I have found that when I involve them in both the decision making and cooking they enjoy it better.
             My older children do a lot of my prep work and can cook for themselves. My younger children are always willing to be the 'mixer' in a 
            receipe. I have found when they cook or help, they eat it.</p>
        </details> 
        <details>
            <summary>9.Don't forget about yourself</summary>
            <p>It is easy with our hectic lives to forget about ourself. Our household has a very busy daily schedule and often times I do forget to
             do things for myself. It's usually my kids that ask me the last time I did something just for me, which is funnybecause I am always doing 
             everything for them, but occasionally I do make time. It can be 5 minutes or 50, but try to take some time every day to re-group.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>10.Date Night</summary>
            <p>It is very important to take a break and get away with your spouse or partner. It doesn't happen often, but I always enjoy going out on a 
            'date' with my husband. Once all of the kids have grown and have left the house, it will just be the two of us. Over the years
            we have learned that we have to be a team and stay connected in eachother daily lives. I am proud to say that my husband is my bestfriend. Like 
            I have always said, "happy wife, happy life".
